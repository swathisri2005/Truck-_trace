                           TRUCKTRACE PROJECT EXPLANATION
                        A Complete Guide for Understanding
================================================================================

WHAT IS TRUCKTRACE?
================================================================================

TruckTrace is a smart computer system that helps trucking companies manage 
their vehicles better. Think of it like a control center that shows where 
all your trucks are, how they're performing, and helps save money on fuel 
and maintenance.

Imagine you own a trucking company with 10 trucks. Instead of calling each 
driver to ask where they are, TruckTrace shows you all trucks on a map in 
real-time. It's like having a bird's eye view of your entire fleet.

WHY WAS THIS PROJECT CREATED?
================================================================================

PROBLEM IT SOLVES:
- Trucking companies lose money because they don't know where their vehicles are
- Drivers take inefficient routes that waste fuel
- Trucks break down unexpectedly, causing expensive delays
- Companies can't track if deliveries are on time
- No way to monitor driver safety and wellness
- Difficult to reduce environmental impact

SOLUTION PROVIDED:
- Real-time tracking of all vehicles on a map
- Smart route suggestions to save fuel
- Early warnings before trucks break down
- Automatic monitoring of delivery performance
- Driver health and safety tracking
- Environmental impact reduction tools

WHO CAN USE THIS SYSTEM?
================================================================================

PRIMARY USERS:
- Small to medium trucking companies (5-50 vehicles)
- Fleet managers who need to track vehicles
- Dispatchers who assign routes and loads
- Company owners who want to reduce costs
- Drivers who want better route guidance

SECONDARY USERS:
- Maintenance managers for vehicle health
- Accountants for cost tracking
- Environmental officers for carbon footprint
- Safety managers for driver wellness

HOW DOES THE SYSTEM WORK?
================================================================================

SIMPLE EXPLANATION:

1. HARDWARE PART (ESP32 GPS Tracker):
   - Small device installed in each truck
   - Uses GPS to know exact location
   - Connects to internet via WiFi
   - Sends location data every 10 seconds
   - Costs only $15 per vehicle to setup

2. SOFTWARE PART (Web Application):
   - Runs on a computer or server
   - Receives data from all GPS trackers
   - Shows information on web pages
   - Anyone can access using web browser
   - Works on computers, tablets, and phones

3. DATA FLOW:
   GPS Tracker → Internet → Server → Dashboard → User

DETAILED WORKFLOW:
- Driver starts truck with GPS tracker
- Tracker gets location from satellites
- Sends location to TruckTrace server
- Server stores data in database
- Dashboard shows live truck locations
- Manager can see all trucks on map
- System calculates fuel savings and efficiency
- Alerts sent for maintenance or problems
